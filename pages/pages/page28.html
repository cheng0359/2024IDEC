<p class="Experiment_content">1.Plasmid extraction for pHCM12M.
2.PCR to verify if the products contain the plasimd of pHCM12M and extract gel DNA of the correct bands.
3.POE-PCR to construct recombinant polymers0/2/4/4/6/6 using pHM12M and PETase0/2/4/6 of 8.13 and extract gel DNA.
4.Colony PCR to verify if the tansformed SCK6 of 8.14 contains the gene of PETase's mutations and sequence.
5.Prepare  plates of LB containing 2% PBAT
6.Shake the bacteria solution containing pHCM12M.</p>
<h4 class="result">Result:</h4>
<p>There are non-specificity bands at the agarose gel, one of them matched the expected results.
The bands of recombinant polymers0/2/4/4/6/6 matched the expected results.
Concentration of polymers:
0: 19.25 1.77
2: 41.12 1.84
4: 17.16 2.30
4: 35.72 1.86
6: 16.32 1.98
6: 44.11 1.85</p>
